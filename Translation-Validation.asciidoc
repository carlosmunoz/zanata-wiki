In order to prevent ill-format translation be putted to Zanata which might break on build stage or execution time, a project maintainer can suggest or even enforced the translation validation.

== Test Basis
=== Terminology
 * Validators: Validation to be performed.
 ** HTML/XML tags: HTML/XML tags should be consistent.
 ** XML entity reference: XML entry in correct format.
 ** Java variables: java style ('\{x}') variables are consistent.
 ** Positional printf (XSI extension): positional printf style (+%n$x+) variables are consistent. It is conflict with printf.
 ** Printf variables: print style (%x) variables are consistent. It is conflict with positional printf.
 ** Leading/trailing newline (\n): Number of leading and trailing newline should be the same.
 ** Tab characters: Number of tab character (\t) should be the same.
 * Validation levels: The degree of the validation is enforced. Default is +Warning+, except positional printf, which is +Off+.
   . Off: Validator is disabled.
   . Warning: Validation is recommended and enabled by default, translator can turn it off.
   . Error: Validation is enforced. Translator cannot save invalid messages.
 * Translator Validation Toggle: A toggle for translator to enable/disable Validator.
 * Invalid translation: A translation message that did not pass at least one enabled Validator.

=== Permission
 * Only project maintainer role can set the validation level for each validator.
 * Only translator role can toggle translator validation toggle.

| Warning | Enabled  | As Warning | Yes
| Error   | Enabled Only |  As Error| No

==== Invalid Translation Handling with Upload and Push
During WebUI upload or client push, if an invalid translation is detected, depending on the validation level, following actions should be taken:

 * Level Off: No validation is executed, thus save as original state (Fuzzy is saved as fuzzy, Translated is saved as translated).
 * Level Warning: Warning is displayed, but still save as original state.
 * Level Error: Error is displayed, and invalid translation is skipped.

.Error Message Template
----
[Error] Validation <ValidatorName> failed: File: <Filename>, Message:  "message" 
----

.Warning Message Template
----
[Warn] Validation <ValidatorName> failed: File: <Filename>, Message:  "message" 
----

However, valid translations in the same file should be save as original state. Following decision table summarizes the behavior:

| Validation Level | Message State | Show Invalid Message | Save as
| Off     | Fuzzy | No  | Fuzzy

| Warning | Fuzzy | As Warning | Fuzzy
| Warning | Translated | As Warning | Translated
| Error | Fuzzy | As Error | Not Saved
| Error | Translated | As Error  | Not Saved

==== Existing Invalid Translations After Changing Validation Level to "Error" or "Warning"
Translations of the Project-Version are not automatically rescan for system performance reason.
However, validators should be run during the pull and download.
