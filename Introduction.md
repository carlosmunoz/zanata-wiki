# Introduction to the Zanata project

# Welcome to Zanata

Zanata is an open source, web-based Translation Management System developed by Red Hat and community contributors. It allows translators to translate
documentation and software online using a web browser. It
is written in Java and uses modern web technologies like
JBoss, Seam, GWT, Hibernate, and a REST API.  It currently
supports translation of DocBook/Publican documentation via gettext PO
files, and translation of software projects via PO files or Java Properties files.  Projects can be pushed to and pulled from a
Zanata server using a Maven plugin or a Python client.

Zanata provides several features to help translators overcome some of the problems during document translation. Such features include:

- **Multi-user editing** - Many translators can work simultaneously on one project.
- **Live editing** - You can see changes from other translators as soon as each message is saved.
- **Multiple project versions** - Zanata tracks current and past versions of projects.

For **developers and writers**: By using Zanata for your translations, you can open up your project for translations
**without** having to open your entire project's version control.

For **translators**: No need to deal with PO files, gettext or
a version control system - just log in to the website, join
a language team and start translating, with translation memory
(history of similar translations) and the ability to see updates
from other translators in seconds.

Zanata has been deployed at [translate.jboss.org](https://translate.jboss.org/) and is ready to accept documentation for jboss.org projects
for translation.  Visit http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Zanata for
instructions on how to get started.
