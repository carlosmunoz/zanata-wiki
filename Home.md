*Note: we are refreshing Zanata's user documentation. You can preview the new documentation at [New Zanata Help Preview](http://zanata.org/help/). The new documentation is for translators, reviewers and maintainers using Zanata - documentation for development of Zanata itself will stay on this wiki.*

# Welcome to the Zanata project

Zanata is an open source, web-based Translation Management System developed by Red Hat and community contributors. It allows translators to translate documentation and software online using a web browser. It is written in Java and uses modern web technologies like JBoss, Seam, GWT, Hibernate, and RESTEasy.  It currently supports translation of DocBook/Publican documentation via gettext PO
files, and translation of software projects via PO files or Java Properties files, and translation of plain text and LibreOffice documents.  Projects can be pushed to and pulled from a Zanata server using a Maven plugin or a Java client, or individual documents can be uploaded through the website.

Zanata provides several features to help translators overcome some of the common problems of document translation. Such features include:

- **Multi-user editing** - Many translators can work simultaneously on one project.
- **Live editing** - Translators can see changes from other translators as soon as each message is saved.
- **Multiple project versions** - Zanata tracks current and past versions of projects.

For **developers and writers**: By using Zanata for your translations, you can open up your project for translations **without** having to open your entire project's version control.

For **translators**: No need to deal with PO files, gettext or a version control system - just log in to the website, join a language team and start translating, with translation memory (history of similar translations) and the ability to see updates from other translators in seconds.

Zanata has been deployed at:

 - [translate.zanata.org](https://translate.zanata.org) for general open source translations. Just sign in with OpenID or create an account.
 - [translate.jboss.org](https://translate.jboss.org/) for jboss.org projects.  Visit http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Zanata for instructions on how to get started.
