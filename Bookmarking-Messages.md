It is now possible to save or share your current location within a document.

This was added in Zanata version 2.3 (see [[bug 723084 | https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=723084]]).

## How to use row bookmarks

 1. Click the bookmark icon just below the source text - this will update the browser address bar to include the bookmarked row.
 1. You can then bookmark the page to save your place for later, or copy and share the URL to refer to the bookmarked row directly, which will load the editor and jump straight to the bookmarked row.

_Note: the bookmarked row will not change until you click a different bookmark icon, even if you move to a different page. This means that refreshing the browser will open the editor at the bookmarked row._

## Jump to row from search results
Bookmarks are also used in project-wide search results. Use the edit icon on the right of a matching row in the search results to jump straight to that row in the editor. When you have edited the row, the browser back button can be used to return to the search results. Any changes you made will be visible in the result table.
