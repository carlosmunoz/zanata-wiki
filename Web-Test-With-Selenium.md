## A Good Test Example
This will be an ever-evolving example along with our test quality and design decisions / improvements.

### Example test


`@Test(DetailedTest.class)` All tests should have this, or BasicAcceptanceTest for high priority classes
<br>
`public class MyTest extends ZanataTestCase {` Extend from the base test class to gain timeouts and reporting.
