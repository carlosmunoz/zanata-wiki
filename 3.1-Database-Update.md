Version 3.1 or Zanata will store files for some uploaded documents on the file system in a configured directory. This directory must be configured with a JNDI property. These files were previously stored as BLOBs in the database, so there is a migration operation to move the files from the database to the file system. Migration is performed when liquibase is run, which will happen automatically at server startup, or can be initiated from the command line.

Zanata requires the directory path to be bound to a JNDI name for normal server operation.
JNDI name: java:global/zanata/files/document-storage-directory

If liquibase run from the command line, JNDI context may not be available, so a liquibase parameter is provided. The value passed to this parameter should match the value bound to the JNDI name.
Liquibase parameter: document.storage.directory ( e.g. -Ddocument.storage.directory=/my/path )
