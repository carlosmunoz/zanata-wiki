# Overview
Version 3.1 or Zanata will store files for some uploaded documents on the file system in a configured directory. This directory must be configured by binding to a JNDI name, but if liquibase is run from the command line the directory must also be passed as a parameter to liquibase.

Since files were previously stored as BLOBs in the database, there is a migration operation to move the files from the database to the file system. Migration is performed when liquibase is run, which will happen automatically at server startup, or can be initiated from the command line.

# Document Storage Directory JNDI name
For normal server operation, Zanata requires the directory path to be bound to the following JNDI name: java:global/zanata/files/document-storage-directory

# Liquibase Parameter
If liquibase run from the command line the JNDI context may not be available, so a liquibase parameter is available to specify the document storage directory. The value passed to this parameter should match the value bound to the above JNDI name.
Liquibase parameter: document.storage.directory ( e.g. -Ddocument.storage.directory=/my/path )
