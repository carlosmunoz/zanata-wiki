This is about https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1092193[Bug 1092193 - Bug 1092193 - RFE: Individual Translator Statistics]

== Test Basis
 * Contribution stats only consists of translated, needReview, approved, rejected.
 * When Person A update translation X, contribution stats should +1 on whichever state Person A last save translation X as.
 * When a reviewer Person B approve or reject a translation of Person A, statistic count goes to Person A. (only translation statistic)
 * When a reviewer Person B starts to translate an empty translation, and save as approved/rejected, statistic count goes to Person B. (Person B translated a string).
 * When a reviewer Person B change a not empty translation done by Person A, and save as approved/rejected, statistic count goes to Person B. Person A count should not be affected. (We are assuming reviewer should not make any changes on translation while in review process)

== Decision Table
Definitions:

THIS USER:: The user that is current login and do the action
LAST USER:: The user who made the latest change before THIS USER.
Same with LAST USER:: LAST USER is also THIS USER, in other word, THIS USER changes his own works.
Credit for THIS USER:: The new statistics THIS USER should obtain.
Credit for LAST USER:: The new statistics LAST USER should obtain.
N/A:: Not applicable, means the combination is not possible.
