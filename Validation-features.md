In Zanata version 2.3, it is now possible to run validations for multiple documents at a time.


## To validate multiple documents

 1. While translating a document, click on the "Document List" icon at the top-right to view a list of documents.
 1. Open the "Validation Options" on the right (the checkbox icon).
 1. Click the "Run validation" button. This will run validation for the documents that are currently visible in the list (if the document list is multiple pages, validation must be run separately for each page).
 1. When validation is complete, an icon is shown next to each document name on the page. A check-mark icon means the document did not have any validation warnings. A cross icon and red document name mean one or more translations in the document caused a warning.
 1. Click a red document name to see all the translations that caused warnings.

Note: validation icons will not change until the next time validation is run on the document, even if the translations are updated. Make sure to re-run validation after making any changes so that the results are accurate.
